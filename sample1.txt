S.H.I.E.L.D. has located the mysterious Tesseract device and the Army's super soldier Captain America. 
The Tesseract is actually a gateway to an entirely new world called Asgard. 
A mysterious being known as Loki arrives on earth and immediately assumes that he can rule all human beings. 
But that irks S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury the wrong way. As Loki escapes with the Tesseract, Nick Fury believes this is an act of war against Earth. His only hope is to assemble an actual team of super heroes. Dr. Bruce Banner, who turns into an enormous green rage monster known as the Hulk. Tony Stark and his venerable Iron Man armor. Captain America, the Stark Enterprises created super soldier. Thor, the god of thunder, protector of Earth and his home planet of Asgard, and Loki's brother. Master assassins Hawkeye and Natasha Romanoff. 
Together they will become a team to take on an attack that will call them to become the greatest of all time.
